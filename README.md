Run Jekyll using Vagrant
------------------------

Jekyll does not support Windows officially at the moment. While there are a few
ways to run it natively, the setup is complex and it may not be ideal if you
need to this on multiple computers.

This repository contains the Vagrant configuration and provisioning in order to
have a working Jekyll installation running on an Ubuntu based virtual machine.
